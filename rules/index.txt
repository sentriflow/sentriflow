## Rule Severity Levels

| Level       | Badge  | Description                                               |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Error**   | High   | Critical security issues that should be fixed immediately |
| **Warning** | Medium | Important best practices that should be addressed         |
| **Info**    | Low    | Recommendations for improved security posture             |

## Rule Categories

Rules are organized into functional categories:

- **Network-Segmentation** - VLAN, trunk, and access port configuration
- **Authentication** - SSH, TACACS+, RADIUS, and local authentication
- **Encryption** - SSL/TLS, IPsec, and encryption settings
- **Access-Control** - ACLs, firewall rules, and zone policies
- **Logging** - Syslog, SNMP traps, and audit logging
- **Hardening** - Service disabling, banner configuration, and timeouts

## Compliance Framework Mappings

Many rules include mappings to common compliance frameworks:

- **NIST 800-53** - Federal information security controls
- **CIS Benchmarks** - Center for Internet Security hardening guides
- **PCI DSS** - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **HIPAA** - Healthcare information privacy requirements
