description: "Integrate SentriFlow into CI/CD pipelines for automated network configuration compliance validation. Supports GitHub Actions, GitLab CI, Azure DevOps, and Jenkins with SARIF reporting and pre-commit hooks."

# CI/CD Integration

Automate network configuration validation in your continuous integration and deployment pipelines. SentriFlow integrates with all major CI/CD platforms.

## Supported Platforms

- **[GitHub Actions](/integrations/github-actions/)** - Native workflow integration with SARIF upload
- **[GitLab CI](/integrations/gitlab-ci/)** - Pipeline configuration with SAST reports
- **[Azure DevOps](/integrations/azure-devops/)** - Azure Pipelines with security scanning
- **[Jenkins](/integrations/jenkins/)** - Declarative pipelines with Warnings NG plugin

## Quick Start

All CI/CD integrations follow a similar pattern:

1. Install SentriFlow CLI
2. Run validation on configuration files
3. Output results in SARIF format
4. Upload results to your platform's security dashboard

```bash
# Basic CI/CD command
sentriflow -f sarif configs/ > results.sarif
```

## Exit Codes

SentriFlow uses standard exit codes for CI/CD integration:

| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| `0` | All checks passed |
| `1` | One or more rule failures detected |
| `2` | Error (invalid input, file not found, etc.) |
