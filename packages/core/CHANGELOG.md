### Minor Changes

- Add support for changesets versioning

  This changeset demonstrates the format used by the changesets tool. Real changesets are
  generated by running `bun changeset` and will have randomly generated filenames like
  `funny-donkeys-dance.md`.

  **Format:**

  - The frontmatter (between `---`) lists affected packages and their bump types
  - The content below becomes the changelog entry
  - Supported bump types: `major`, `minor`, `patch`

  **Note:** This is an example file. Delete it before running `bun version` or it will be
  consumed as a real changeset.
