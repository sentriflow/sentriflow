- Use a clear, descriptive title
- Include steps to reproduce the issue
- Specify the vendor/platform if relevant

### Adding New Rules

1. Place rules in the appropriate vendor file under `packages/rules-default/src/`
2. Follow the rule ID format: `[A-Z][A-Z0-9_-]{2,49}` (e.g., `SEC-001`, `NET-TRUNK-001`)
3. Include metadata: `severity`, `remediation`
4. Add test fixtures in `packages/rules-default/test/fixtures/`

See [Rule Authoring Guide](https://github.com/sentriflow/sentriflow/blob/main/docs/RULE_AUTHORING_GUIDE.md) for detailed instructions.

### Adding Vendor Support

1. Create vendor schema in `packages/core/src/parser/`
2. Add helper functions in `packages/core/src/helpers/<vendor>/`
3. Add vendor identifier to the supported vendors list
4. Include test configurations

## Code Style

- TypeScript strict mode is enabled
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Follow existing patterns in the codebase
- Run `bun run type-check` before submitting
