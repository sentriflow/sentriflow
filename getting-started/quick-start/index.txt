title: "Quick Start: Validate Your First Network Configuration"
description: "Get started with SentriFlow in under 5 minutes. Install the CLI, scan a sample Cisco IOS router configuration, and understand security findings including severity levels, rule IDs, and remediation steps."
---

import { Callout, Steps, Tabs, FileTree } from 'nextra/components';

# Quick Start

<Callout type="info">
**Time to complete:** Approximately 5 minutes

This guide walks you through installing SentriFlow and validating your first configuration file.

</Callout>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js 18+** or **Bun 1.0+** installed
- A terminal or command prompt
- A network configuration file (or use our sample below)

<Steps>

### Install SentriFlow CLI

Install the CLI globally using your preferred package manager:

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash npm install -g @sentriflow/cli ```</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash yarn global add @sentriflow/cli ```</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash pnpm add -g @sentriflow/cli ```</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash bun install -g @sentriflow/cli ```</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

Verify the installation:

```bash
sentriflow --version
```

**Expected output:**

```text
1.x.x
```

### Create a Sample Configuration

Create a file named `router.conf` with the following Cisco IOS configuration that contains some common security issues:

```text filename="router.conf"
!
! Sample router configuration with security issues
!
hostname TestRouter
!
enable secret 5 $1$mERr$hVzf3aV3e5j3e4K5cTf7K1
!
ip ssh version 1
ip ssh time-out 120
!
line vty 0 4
 password cisco123
 login
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 description Uplink to Core
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 description User Access Port
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
 no shutdown
!
snmp-server community public RO
!
logging buffered 4096
!
end
```

This sample configuration intentionally includes several security issues that SentriFlow will detect:

| Issue                 | Description                                    |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| SSH Version 1         | Outdated and insecure SSH protocol             |
| Weak VTY Password     | Plain text password on virtual terminal lines  |
| Public SNMP Community | Default community string is easily guessable   |
| Small Logging Buffer  | Insufficient buffer size for forensic analysis |

### Run Validation

Validate the configuration file:

```bash
sentriflow router.conf
```

**Expected output (JSON format):**

```json
{
  "vendor": {
    "id": "cisco-ios",
    "name": "Cisco IOS"
  },
  "results": [
    {
      "passed": false,
      "message": "SSH version 1 is deprecated and insecure.",
      "ruleId": "NET-SSH-001",
      "nodeId": "ip ssh version 1",
      "level": "error",
      "remediation": "Configure 'ip ssh version 2' to use SSHv2."
    },
    {
      "passed": false,
      "message": "VTY line uses weak password authentication.",
      "ruleId": "NET-VTY-002",
      "nodeId": "line vty 0 4",
      "level": "warning",
      "remediation": "Replace password with 'login local' and use strong local accounts."
    }
  ]
}
```

<Callout type='warning'>
  The CLI exits with code **1** when any rule failures are detected. This
  enables CI/CD integration where non-zero exit codes indicate problems.
</Callout>

### Understand the Output

SentriFlow outputs results in JSON format by default. Each result contains:

| Field         | Description                                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `passed`      | `true` if the check passed, `false` if it failed     |
| `ruleId`      | Unique identifier for the rule (e.g., `NET-SSH-001`) |
| `nodeId`      | The configuration element that was checked           |
| `level`       | Severity: `error`, `warning`, or `info`              |
| `message`     | Human-readable description of the issue              |
| `remediation` | Suggested fix for the problem                        |
| `loc`         | Line numbers where the issue was found               |

#### Severity Levels

| Level     | Icon          | Description                                           | CI/CD Impact    |
| --------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| `error`   | **Critical**  | Security vulnerabilities or compliance violations     | Fails the build |
| `warning` | **Important** | Best practice deviations or hardening recommendations | Fails the build |
| `info`    | **Note**      | Informational findings or passed checks               | No impact       |

### Generate SARIF Output (Optional)

For CI/CD integration with GitHub Advanced Security, GitLab SAST, or Azure DevOps:

```bash
sentriflow -f sarif router.conf > results.sarif
```

The SARIF format is a standardized format for static analysis results that integrates with security dashboards.

</Steps>

## Filtering Results

### Show Only Failures

Use quiet mode to suppress passed results:

```bash
sentriflow -q router.conf
```

### Disable Specific Rules

Skip rules that don't apply to your environment:

```bash
sentriflow -d NET-SSH-001,NET-VTY-002 router.conf
```

### Specify Vendor Type

If auto-detection fails, specify the vendor explicitly:

```bash
sentriflow -v cisco router.conf
```

Available vendors: `cisco`, `cisco-nxos`, `juniper`, `arista`, `paloalto`, `fortinet`, `vyos`, `mikrotik`, `nokia-sros`, `huawei`, `extreme-exos`, `extreme-voss`.

## Validating Multiple Files

### Multiple Files

Validate several files at once:

```bash
sentriflow router1.conf router2.conf switch.conf
```

### Directory Scanning

Scan all configuration files in a directory:

```bash
sentriflow -D ./configs
```

Recursively scan subdirectories:

```bash
sentriflow -D ./configs -R
```

Show progress during scanning:

```bash
sentriflow -D ./configs -R --progress
```

## Exit Codes

SentriFlow uses standard exit codes for CI/CD integration:

| Code | Meaning                                     |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `0`  | All checks passed                           |
| `1`  | One or more rule failures detected          |
| `2`  | Error (invalid input, file not found, etc.) |

## Common First-Time Issues

<Callout type="error" title="File not found">
**Error:** `Error: File not found: router.conf`

Ensure you're in the correct directory or provide an absolute path:

```bash
sentriflow /path/to/router.conf
```

</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Unknown vendor">
**Error:** `Error: Could not detect vendor for configuration`

SentriFlow couldn't auto-detect the configuration type. Specify the vendor explicitly:

```bash
sentriflow -v cisco router.conf
```

</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="Permission denied">
**Error:** `Error: Path is outside current working directory`

By default, SentriFlow restricts file access to the current directory for security. Use the `--allow-external` flag for files outside:

```bash
sentriflow --allow-external /etc/network/router.conf
```

</Callout>

<Callout type="error" title="File too large">
**Error:** `Error: File size exceeds maximum allowed`

Configuration files larger than 10MB are rejected. Split large files or contact support for enterprise solutions.

</Callout>

## What's Next?

Now that you've validated your first configuration, explore these resources:

- **[CLI Reference](/cli/commands)** - Complete command-line options and examples
- **[VS Code Extension](/getting-started/vscode)** - Real-time validation in your editor
- **[Rule Catalog](/rules)** - Browse all 59 built-in security rules
- **[GitHub Actions](/integrations/github-actions)** - Automate validation in your CI/CD pipeline
- **[Custom Rules](/authoring/json-rules)** - Create rules specific to your organization

<Callout type="tip">
**Pro tip:** Create a `.sentriflowrc.json` configuration file to save your preferred options:

```json filename=".sentriflowrc.json"
{
  "vendor": "cisco-ios",
  "quiet": true,
  "disable": ["NET-DOC-001"]
}
```

SentriFlow automatically loads this file from the current directory.
