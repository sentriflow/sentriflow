# Parser API

The SentriFlow parser transforms network configuration text into a structured AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) that can be traversed and validated. This page covers the parser API for programmatic integration.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @sentriflow/core
```

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { SchemaAwareParser } from '@sentriflow/core';

const config = `
hostname Router1
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
`;

const parser = new SchemaAwareParser();
const ast = parser.parse(config);

// ast is an array of ConfigNode objects
console.log(ast.length);
```

## SchemaAwareParser

The `SchemaAwareParser` class is the primary parser for SentriFlow. It automatically detects the vendor format and parses configuration text into an AST.

### Constructor

```typescript
const parser = new SchemaAwareParser();
```

### parse()

Parse configuration text into an AST.

#### Signature

```typescript
class SchemaAwareParser {
  parse(config: string, options?: ParseOptions): ConfigNode[]
}
```

#### Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `config` | `string` | Yes | Configuration text to parse |
| `options` | `ParseOptions` | No | Parser options |

#### ParseOptions

```typescript
interface ParseOptions {
  /** Include comments in AST */
  includeComments?: boolean;

  /** Include empty lines as nodes */
  includeEmpty?: boolean;

  /** Starting line number (for partial parsing) */
  startLine?: number;

  /** Enable strict mode (fail on unknown commands) */
  strict?: boolean;
}
```

#### Returns

Returns an array of `ConfigNode` objects representing the parsed configuration.

#### Example

```typescript
import { SchemaAwareParser } from '@sentriflow/core';

const config = `
! This is a comment
hostname Router1
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 description Uplink to Core
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
`;

const parser = new SchemaAwareParser();

// Parse with default options (auto-detects vendor)
const ast = parser.parse(config);

// Parse with comments included
const astWithComments = parser.parse(config, {
  includeComments: true,
});

// Parse in strict mode
try {
  const strictAst = parser.parse(config, { strict: true });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Parse error:', error.message);
}
```

## detectVendor()

Auto-detect vendor from configuration content.

### Signature

```typescript
function detectVendor(config: string): VendorSchema | undefined
```

### Detection Heuristics

The vendor is detected based on:
- Header comments (e.g., `! sentriflow: vendor=cisco-ios`)
- Command patterns (e.g., `set` commands indicate Juniper)
- Section structure
- Keyword frequency

### Example

```typescript
import { detectVendor, SchemaAwareParser } from '@sentriflow/core';

const config = `
hostname Router1
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
`;

const vendorSchema = detectVendor(config);

if (vendorSchema) {
  console.log(`Detected vendor: ${vendorSchema.name}`);
}

// Note: SchemaAwareParser auto-detects vendor, so you typically
// don't need to call detectVendor() manually
const parser = new SchemaAwareParser();
const ast = parser.parse(config);
```

## IncrementalParser

For scenarios where configuration is being edited in real-time (such as in an IDE), the `IncrementalParser` provides efficient incremental parsing capabilities.

### Basic Usage

```typescript
import { IncrementalParser } from '@sentriflow/core';

const parser = new IncrementalParser();

// Initial parse
let ast = parser.parse(config);

// After edits, incrementally update the AST
ast = parser.update(newConfig, changes);
```

<Callout type="info">
The `IncrementalParser` is optimized for scenarios with frequent small edits, such as IDE integrations. For one-time parsing of complete configurations, use `SchemaAwareParser` instead.
</Callout>

## Supported Vendors

The parser automatically detects and handles configurations from these vendors:

| Vendor | Format | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `cisco-ios` | Hierarchical | IOS, IOS-XE, IOS-XR |
| `cisco-nxos` | Hierarchical | Nexus switches |
| `juniper-junos` | Set/Hierarchical | Set and hierarchical formats |
| `paloalto-panos` | Set commands | Set command format |
| `arista-eos` | Hierarchical | EOS configuration |
| `vyos` | Hierarchical | VyOS/EdgeOS |
| `fortinet-fortigate` | Hierarchical | FortiOS config |

## Error Handling

The parser throws errors for invalid configurations when strict mode is enabled:

```typescript
import { SchemaAwareParser } from '@sentriflow/core';

const parser = new SchemaAwareParser();

try {
  const ast = parser.parse(config, { strict: true });
} catch (error) {
  console.error(`Parse error: ${error.message}`);
}
```

<Callout type="warning">
By default, the parser operates in lenient mode and will attempt to parse configurations even if they contain unrecognized commands. Use `strict: true` to catch all parsing issues.
</Callout>

## Performance Considerations

- Use `SchemaAwareParser` for one-time parsing of complete configurations
- Use `IncrementalParser` for IDE integrations with frequent edits
- Consider `includeComments: false` if comments aren't needed for your use case
- The parser automatically optimizes for the detected vendor format
