title: The Complete Cisco IOS Security Hardening Checklist (2026)
description: A comprehensive, actionable checklist for hardening Cisco IOS and IOS-XE router and switch configurations against common security misconfigurations, with automated validation using SentriFlow.
---

import { Callout, Steps, Tabs } from 'nextra/components';

# The Complete Cisco IOS Security Hardening Checklist (2026)

Cisco IOS powers the majority of enterprise network infrastructure worldwide. Yet most production configurations contain preventable security misconfigurations — from plaintext passwords to unprotected management interfaces.

This checklist covers the most critical Cisco IOS and IOS-XE hardening items based on CIS Benchmarks, NIST 800-53 controls, and real-world audit findings. Each item includes the vulnerable configuration, the hardened fix, and the [SentriFlow rule](/rules) that detects it automatically.

<Callout type="info">
**Automate this checklist.** Every item below can be validated automatically with SentriFlow. [Install the CLI](/getting-started/installation) and run `sentriflow router.conf` to audit your configurations in seconds.
</Callout>

---

## 1. Password and Authentication Security

### 1.1 Never Use Plaintext Passwords

The `password` command stores credentials in plaintext or weak Type 7 encoding, which is trivially reversible.

**Vulnerable configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (insecure)"
enable password cisco123
!
line vty 0 4
 password cisco123
 login
```

**Hardened configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (hardened)"
enable algorithm-type scrypt secret MyStr0ngP@ss!
!
line vty 0 4
 login local
!
username admin privilege 15 algorithm-type scrypt secret MyStr0ngP@ss!
```

**Why it matters:** Type 0 (plaintext) and Type 7 passwords can be decoded instantly with freely available tools. Type 5 (MD5) is considered weak. Use Type 8 (PBKDF2) or Type 9 (scrypt) for strong encryption.

<Callout type="warning">
**SentriFlow rule:** [NET-SEC-001](/rules) — Detects plaintext or weakly encrypted passwords across Cisco IOS and NX-OS configurations.
</Callout>

### 1.2 Use Strong Enable Secret

The enable secret protects privileged EXEC mode. Always use scrypt hashing.

**Hardened configuration:**

```text
enable algorithm-type scrypt secret <strong-password>
```

<Callout type="warning">
**SentriFlow rule:** [NET-AAA-003](/rules) — Ensures the enable secret uses strong encryption (scrypt recommended).
</Callout>

### 1.3 Configure AAA Authentication

Centralized authentication via TACACS+ or RADIUS provides accountability and stronger access control.

```text filename="AAA configuration"
aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ local
aaa authorization exec default group tacacs+ local
aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs+
!
tacacs-server host 10.1.1.100 key 0 <encrypted-key>
tacacs-server host 10.1.1.101 key 0 <encrypted-key>
```

**Why it matters:** Local-only authentication doesn't provide centralized audit trails. If a credential is compromised, you must touch every device individually to rotate it.

---

## 2. SSH and Remote Access Hardening

### 2.1 Enforce SSH Version 2

SSH version 1 has known cryptographic weaknesses and should never be used in production.

**Vulnerable configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (insecure)"
ip ssh version 1
```

**Hardened configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (hardened)"
ip ssh version 2
ip ssh time-out 60
ip ssh authentication-retries 3
```

### 2.2 Restrict VTY Line Access

VTY lines (virtual terminal lines) control remote access to the router. They should be locked down with ACLs and SSH-only transport.

**Vulnerable configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (insecure)"
line vty 0 4
 password cisco123
 login
 transport input all
```

**Hardened configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (hardened)"
ip access-list standard VTY-ACCESS
 permit 10.0.0.0 0.0.0.255
 deny any log
!
line vty 0 4
 access-class VTY-ACCESS in
 transport input ssh
 login local
 exec-timeout 5 0
 logging synchronous
line vty 5 15
 access-class VTY-ACCESS in
 transport input ssh
 login local
 exec-timeout 5 0
```

**Key hardening items:**
- `transport input ssh` — Disables telnet, allowing only encrypted SSH connections
- `access-class VTY-ACCESS in` — Restricts which IP addresses can connect
- `exec-timeout 5 0` — Automatically disconnects idle sessions after 5 minutes
- Configure **all** VTY lines (0-15), not just 0-4

<Callout type="warning">
**SentriFlow rule:** [JSON-CISCO-005](/rules) — Ensures VTY lines have access-class configured for SSH access control.
</Callout>

### 2.3 Disable Telnet Everywhere

Telnet sends everything in plaintext, including credentials.

```text
line vty 0 15
 transport input ssh
!
line con 0
 transport output ssh
```

---

## 3. SNMP Security

### 3.1 Never Use Default Community Strings

The community strings `public` and `private` are the first things attackers try.

**Vulnerable configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (insecure)"
snmp-server community public RO
snmp-server community private RW
```

**Hardened configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (hardened)"
! Use SNMPv3 with authentication and encryption
snmp-server group MONITORING v3 priv
snmp-server user monitor MONITORING v3 auth sha <auth-pass> priv aes 256 <priv-pass>
!
! If SNMPv2c is required, use complex strings and ACLs
snmp-server community xK9#mP2$vL7@nQ RO SNMP-ACL
!
ip access-list standard SNMP-ACL
 permit 10.1.1.0 0.0.0.255
 deny any log
```

**Why it matters:** SNMP with read-write access and a default community string gives an attacker full control over the device configuration.

---

## 4. Network Segmentation and Layer 2 Security

### 4.1 Disable DTP on All Trunk Ports

Dynamic Trunking Protocol (DTP) can be exploited for VLAN hopping attacks.

**Vulnerable configuration:**

```text filename="switch.conf (insecure)"
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode trunk
```

**Hardened configuration:**

```text filename="switch.conf (hardened)"
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 switchport mode trunk
 switchport nonegotiate
 switchport trunk allowed vlan 10,20,30
```

<Callout type="warning">
**SentriFlow rules:**
- [NET-TRUNK-001](/rules) — Detects trunk ports without `switchport nonegotiate`
- [JSON-CISCO-001](/rules) — Ensures trunk ports have an explicit allowed VLAN list
- [JSON-CISCO-004](/rules) — Flags trunk ports without DTP disabled (tagged: vlan-hopping)
</Callout>

### 4.2 Explicitly Configure Access Ports

Don't rely on default port modes. Explicitly set access mode and assign VLANs.

**Hardened configuration:**

```text filename="switch.conf (hardened)"
interface GigabitEthernet0/2
 description User Access - Desk 42A
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 10
 spanning-tree portfast
 spanning-tree bpduguard enable
```

<Callout type="warning">
**SentriFlow rules:**
- [NET-ACCESS-001](/rules) — Ensures interfaces have explicit `switchport mode access`
- [JSON-CISCO-002](/rules) — Checks that access ports have spanning-tree portfast enabled
</Callout>

### 4.3 Secure Unused Ports

Unused ports are a common attack vector for physical access.

```text filename="Shutdown unused ports"
interface range GigabitEthernet0/10-24
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan 999
 shutdown
!
vlan 999
 name BLACKHOLE
```

---

## 5. Logging and Monitoring

### 5.1 Configure Adequate Logging Buffer

A small logging buffer loses critical forensic information.

**Vulnerable configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (insecure)"
logging buffered 4096
```

**Hardened configuration:**

```text filename="router.conf (hardened)"
logging buffered 131072 informational
logging trap informational
logging source-interface Loopback0
logging host 10.1.1.200
logging host 10.1.1.201
!
service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone
service timestamps debug datetime msec localtime show-timezone
```

**Recommended buffer sizes:**
| Device Role | Minimum Buffer Size |
|------------|-------------------|
| Access switch | 64 KB (65536) |
| Distribution switch | 128 KB (131072) |
| Core router | 256 KB (262144) |
| Internet edge | 512 KB (524288) |

### 5.2 Enable Remote Syslog

Local logging alone is insufficient. Send logs to a centralized SIEM.

```text
logging host 10.1.1.200 transport tcp port 6514
logging host 10.1.1.201 transport tcp port 6514
```

---

## 6. Service Hardening

### 6.1 Disable Unnecessary Services

Every enabled service is a potential attack surface.

```text filename="Disable unnecessary services"
no ip http server
no ip http secure-server
no cdp run
no ip source-route
no ip finger
no service pad
no service udp-small-servers
no service tcp-small-servers
no ip bootp server
no ip gratuitous-arps
```

### 6.2 Configure a Login Banner

Login banners provide legal notice and deter unauthorized access.

```text
banner login ^
*********************************************************************
* UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO THIS DEVICE IS PROHIBITED.                 *
* All connections are monitored and recorded.                       *
* Disconnect IMMEDIATELY if you are not an authorized user.         *
*********************************************************************
^
```

---

## 7. Interface Documentation

### 7.1 Add Descriptions to All Interfaces

Interface descriptions are essential for operational clarity during outages and audits.

**Missing documentation:**

```text filename="switch.conf (undocumented)"
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
```

**Properly documented:**

```text filename="switch.conf (documented)"
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 description [WAN] Link to ISP-A | Circuit: CKT-12345 | 1Gbps
 ip address 10.0.0.1 255.255.255.252
 no shutdown
```

<Callout type="warning">
**SentriFlow rule:** [JSON-CISCO-003](/rules) — Ensures all interfaces have a description for documentation.
</Callout>

---

## 8. Routing Protocol Security

### 8.1 Authenticate Routing Protocols

Unauthenticated routing protocols allow attackers to inject malicious routes.

```text filename="OSPF authentication"
router ospf 1
 area 0 authentication message-digest
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/1
 ip ospf message-digest-key 1 md5 <key>
 ip ospf authentication message-digest
```

```text filename="BGP authentication"
router bgp 65001
 neighbor 10.0.0.2 remote-as 65002
 neighbor 10.0.0.2 password <key>
```

---
