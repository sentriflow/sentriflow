# Automating Network Compliance Checks: A Practical Guide

Manual network configuration reviews are slow, inconsistent, and don't scale. A single engineer might review 5-10 configurations per hour. A fleet of 500 devices means weeks of work — and by the time you're done, the first configs have already drifted.

This guide shows you how to build an automated compliance checking pipeline using SentriFlow that validates every configuration change against security baselines, flags violations immediately, and generates audit-ready reports.

<Callout type="info">
**What you'll build:** By the end of this guide, you'll have automated compliance validation running in your CI/CD pipeline, catching misconfigurations before they reach production.
</Callout>

---

## Why Automate Network Compliance?

### The Problem with Manual Reviews

Most network teams rely on one of these approaches:

1. **Spreadsheet checklists** — An engineer manually compares each device config against a list of required settings. Slow and error-prone.
2. **Periodic audits** — Quarterly or annual audits by external firms. Finds issues months after introduction.
3. **Tribal knowledge** — Senior engineers "just know" what to look for. Doesn't scale and creates single points of failure.

### What Automation Gives You

| Manual Reviews | Automated Validation |
|---------------|---------------------|
| 5-10 configs per hour | Hundreds of configs in seconds |
| Inconsistent results across reviewers | Same rules applied every time |
| Finds issues weeks/months later | Catches issues at commit time |
| PDF reports that collect dust | Machine-readable output (SARIF, JSON) |
| One-time snapshot | Continuous monitoring |

---

## Getting Started with SentriFlow

SentriFlow is an open-source validation framework that parses network device configurations into a structured format and evaluates them against security rules. It supports [12 vendor platforms](/rules) including Cisco IOS, Juniper Junos, Palo Alto PAN-OS, Fortinet FortiGate, and more.

<Steps>

### Install the CLI

<Tabs items={['npm', 'yarn', 'pnpm', 'bun']}>
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash npm install -g @sentriflow/cli ```</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash yarn global add @sentriflow/cli ```</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash pnpm add -g @sentriflow/cli ```</Tabs.Tab>
  <Tabs.Tab>```bash bun install -g @sentriflow/cli ```</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

### Validate a Single Configuration

```bash
sentriflow router.conf
```

SentriFlow auto-detects the vendor and applies the appropriate rule set. You'll see results like:

```text
router.conf:45:3 error NET-SEC-001  Plaintext password detected
router.conf:12:1 warning NET-TRUNK-001  Trunk port missing 'switchport nonegotiate'
router.conf:67:1 warning JSON-CISCO-003  Interface missing description

3 issues (1 error, 2 warnings) in router.conf
```

### Scan an Entire Directory

Point SentriFlow at your configuration repository:

```bash
sentriflow -D ./network-configs -R --progress
```

The `-R` flag enables recursive scanning, and `--progress` shows real-time status.

</Steps>

---

## Storing Configurations in Git

The first step toward automation is version-controlling your network configurations. If your configs aren't in Git yet, here's a recommended repository structure:

```text
network-configs/
├── datacenter/
│   ├── core-rtr-01.conf          # Cisco IOS
│   ├── core-rtr-02.conf          # Cisco IOS
│   ├── dist-sw-01.conf           # Arista EOS
│   └── dist-sw-02.conf           # Arista EOS
├── campus/
│   ├── bldg-a-sw-01.conf         # Cisco IOS
│   ├── bldg-a-sw-02.conf         # Cisco IOS
│   └── bldg-a-wlc-01.conf       # Aruba WLC
├── wan/
│   ├── edge-rtr-01.conf          # Juniper Junos
│   └── edge-fw-01.conf           # Palo Alto PAN-OS
└── .github/
    └── workflows/
        └── sentriflow.yml        # Automated validation
```

<Callout type="tip">
**Config backup tools** like [Oxidized](https://github.com/ytti/oxidized), [RANCID](https://www.shrubbery.net/rancid/), or Ansible `ios_config` backups can automatically commit configurations to Git on a schedule.
</Callout>

---

## CI/CD Integration

### GitHub Actions

The most common setup: validate every pull request that modifies a configuration file.

```yaml filename=".github/workflows/sentriflow.yml"
name: Network Config Validation

on:
  pull_request:
    paths:
      - '**/*.conf'
      - '**/*.cfg'

jobs:
  validate:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install SentriFlow
        run: npm install -g @sentriflow/cli

      - name: Validate configurations
        run: sentriflow -D . -R -f sarif > results.sarif
        continue-on-error: true

      - name: Upload SARIF results
        uses: github/codeql-action/upload-sarif@v3
        with:
          sarif_file: results.sarif
```

**What this does:**
1. Triggers on any PR that modifies `.conf` or `.cfg` files
2. Scans all configuration files recursively
3. Outputs results in SARIF format
4. Uploads to GitHub Advanced Security for inline PR annotations

Engineers see violations directly on the pull request — no context switching to a separate tool.

### GitLab CI

```yaml filename=".gitlab-ci.yml"
sentriflow:
  stage: test
  image: node:20
  before_script:
    - npm install -g @sentriflow/cli
  script:
    - sentriflow -D . -R -f sarif > gl-sast-report.json
  artifacts:
    reports:
      sast: gl-sast-report.json
  rules:
    - changes:
        - "**/*.conf"
        - "**/*.cfg"
```

### Jenkins

```groovy filename="Jenkinsfile"
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Validate Configs') {
            steps {
                sh 'npm install -g @sentriflow/cli'
                sh 'sentriflow -D ./configs -R -f sarif > results.sarif'
            }
            post {
                always {
                    recordIssues(
                        tools: [sarif(pattern: 'results.sarif')]
                    )
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Multi-Vendor Compliance

Real networks run multiple vendors. SentriFlow handles this automatically through vendor detection — no per-vendor configuration needed.

```bash
# Scan a directory containing Cisco, Juniper, Palo Alto, and Fortinet configs
sentriflow -D ./configs -R
```

SentriFlow parses each file, detects the vendor, and applies the correct rule set:

| Vendor | Platforms | Rules |
|--------|-----------|-------|
| Cisco | IOS, IOS-XE, NX-OS, ASA | 10 rules |
| Juniper | Junos | 8 rules |
| Palo Alto | PAN-OS | 3 rules |
| Fortinet | FortiGate | 3 rules |
| Arista | EOS | 3 rules |
| Aruba | AOS-CX, AOS-Switch, WLC | 12 rules |
| + 6 more vendors | | |

If auto-detection fails for a specific file, override it:

```bash
sentriflow -v juniper edge-router.conf
```

---

## Understanding Configuration Drift

**Configuration drift** is when a device's running configuration diverges from the approved baseline over time. Common causes:

- Emergency changes made at 2 AM that never get documented
- Copy-paste errors during maintenance windows
- Vendor software upgrades that reset defaults
- Different engineers with different standards

### Detecting Drift with SentriFlow

By running SentriFlow on every configuration commit, you establish a **compliance baseline**. Any new violation indicates drift:

```bash
# Compare current scan against a known-good baseline
sentriflow -D ./configs -R -q
```

The `-q` (quiet) flag shows only failures, making it easy to spot new issues.

### Preventing Drift

The most effective anti-drift strategy combines:

1. **Pre-commit validation** — SentriFlow in CI/CD catches drift at the source
2. **Scheduled scans** — Periodic full-fleet audits catch drift from out-of-band changes
3. **Configuration templates** — Generate configs from templates (Jinja2, Ansible) to reduce manual edits

---

## Custom Compliance Rules

Every organization has unique requirements beyond generic best practices. SentriFlow supports custom rules in JSON or TypeScript.

### JSON Rules (No Code Required)

Create a `.sentriflow/rules/` directory in your repository:

```json filename=".sentriflow/rules/corporate-standards.json"
[
  {
    "id": "CORP-NTP-001",
    "name": "Corporate NTP servers required",
    "description": "All devices must use the corporate NTP servers",
    "severity": "warning",
    "vendor": "cisco-ios",
    "selector": "ntp server",
    "condition": {
      "type": "must-exist"
    },
    "remediation": "Configure: ntp server 10.1.1.10 / ntp server 10.1.1.11"
  },
  {
    "id": "CORP-BANNER-001",
    "name": "Legal banner required",
    "description": "All devices must display the corporate login banner",
    "severity": "warning",
    "vendor": "cisco-ios",
    "selector": "banner login",
    "condition": {
      "type": "must-exist"
    },
    "remediation": "Configure a banner login with the corporate legal notice"
  }
]
```

### TypeScript Rules (Full Control)

For complex logic that JSON can't express:

```typescript filename=".sentriflow/rules/password-complexity.ts"
import { defineRule } from '@sentriflow/core';

export default defineRule({
  id: 'CORP-PWD-001',
  name: 'Password complexity check',
  severity: 'error',
  selector: 'username',

  check(node, context) {
    // Ensure no username has a simple password
    const hasSecret = context.findChild(node, 'secret');
    const hasPassword = context.findChild(node, 'password');

    if (hasPassword && !hasSecret) {
      return {
        passed: false,
        message: `User "${node.params[0]}" uses weak password type`,
        line: node.line,
      };
    }

    return { passed: true };
  },
});
```

See the full [JSON Rules Guide](/authoring/json-rules) and [TypeScript Rules Guide](/authoring/typescript-rules) for more.

---

## Generating Compliance Reports

### SARIF (for CI/CD Dashboards)

```bash
sentriflow -D ./configs -R -f sarif > report.sarif
```

SARIF (Static Analysis Results Interchange Format) integrates natively with:
- GitHub Advanced Security
- GitLab Security Dashboard
- Azure DevOps
- Jenkins Warnings NG

### JSON (for Custom Processing)

```bash
sentriflow -D ./configs -R -f json > report.json
```

Pipe JSON output into your existing tools — SIEM, ticketing systems, or custom dashboards.

### Human-Readable (for Reviews)

```bash
sentriflow -D ./configs -R
```

The default output is formatted for human reading with file paths, line numbers, and severity indicators.

---

## Compliance Frameworks

SentriFlow's built-in rules align with major compliance frameworks:

| Framework | Coverage | Key Areas |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **CIS Benchmarks** | Cisco IOS, Juniper Junos | Authentication, access control, logging |
| **NIST 800-53** | Multi-vendor | AC (Access Control), AU (Audit), IA (Identification/Authentication) |
| **PCI DSS** | Multi-vendor | Requirement 1 (firewalls), Requirement 2 (defaults), Requirement 10 (logging) |
| **HIPAA** | Multi-vendor | Administrative, technical, and physical safeguards |

**The result:** Every configuration change is validated automatically. Engineers get immediate feedback. Auditors get continuous compliance evidence. No more quarterly fire drills.

## Next Steps

<Steps>

### Start with a Pilot

Pick one device type (e.g., Cisco IOS switches) and one environment (e.g., lab). Get validation running and tune the rules.

### Expand to Production

Once confident in the rule set, roll out to production configurations. Use `-q` (quiet mode) initially to focus on failures only.

### Add Custom Rules

Layer on organization-specific rules for NTP, DNS, banners, naming conventions, and other internal standards.

### Integrate with Change Management

Wire SentriFlow into your change approval workflow. No configuration PR gets merged without a clean scan.

</Steps>
