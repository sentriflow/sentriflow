# VS Code Extension Installation

The SentriFlow VS Code extension provides real-time validation of network configuration files directly in your editor. Get instant feedback on security issues, misconfigurations, and compliance violations as you work.

## Prerequisites

- VS Code version 1.85.0 or later
- Node.js 18+ (for the SentriFlow language server)

## Installation Methods

<Tabs items={['VS Code Marketplace', 'VSIX File', 'Command Line']}>

<Tabs.Tab>

### VS Code Marketplace

The easiest way to install the extension:

<Steps>

code --install-extension sentriflow.sentriflow-vscode

# Install from VSIX file
code --install-extension sentriflow-vscode-1.0.0.vsix
```

</Tabs.Tab>

</Tabs>

## Initial Configuration

After installation, configure the extension for your environment:

### 1. File Associations

The extension automatically validates files with these extensions:
- `.conf` - Configuration files
- `.cfg` - Configuration files
- `.txt` - Text files (when in a config directory)

To add custom file associations, update your VS Code settings:

```json filename="settings.json"
{
  "files.associations": {
    "*.config": "sentriflow",
    "*.network": "sentriflow"
  }
}
```

### 2. Vendor Selection

Set the default vendor for automatic detection:

```json filename="settings.json"
{
  "sentriflow.defaultVendor": "cisco-ios"
}
```

Or use file-based detection with header comments:

```text filename="router.conf"
! sentriflow: vendor=cisco-ios
hostname Router1
...
```

### 3. Severity Threshold

Control which issues appear in the Problems panel:

```json filename="settings.json"
{
  "sentriflow.minimumSeverity": "warning"
}
```

Options: `"error"`, `"warning"`, `"info"`

## Workspace Configuration

For team consistency, add settings to your workspace:

```json filename=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "sentriflow.defaultVendor": "cisco-ios",
  "sentriflow.minimumSeverity": "warning",
  "sentriflow.customRules": [
    "${workspaceFolder}/rules/org-security.json"
  ],
  "sentriflow.excludePatterns": [
    "**/test-configs/**",
    "**/examples/**"
  ]
}
```

## Verify Installation

<Steps>

### Create Test File

Create a file named `test.conf` with this content:

```text filename="test.conf"
hostname TestRouter
!
interface GigabitEthernet0/0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
 no shutdown
!
line vty 0 4
 transport input telnet
```

### Check Problems Panel

Open the Problems panel (`Ctrl+Shift+M` / `Cmd+Shift+M`). You should see issues flagged:

- Warning: Telnet enabled on VTY lines
- Warning: Interface missing description

### View Diagnostics

Hover over underlined configuration lines to see issue details and remediation suggestions.

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

### Extension Not Loading

1. Check VS Code version: `Help > About`
2. Verify extension is enabled: `Extensions > SentriFlow > Enable`
3. Check Output panel: `View > Output` then select "SentriFlow"

### No Diagnostics Appearing

1. Verify file association: Status bar should show "SentriFlow"
2. Check minimum severity setting
3. Try setting vendor explicitly in file header

### Language Server Errors

<Callout type="warning">
  If you see "Language server failed to start", check that Node.js 18+ is installed and in your PATH.
</Callout>

```bash
# Check Node.js version
node --version  # Should be 18.0.0 or higher
```

### High Memory Usage

For large configuration files, enable incremental validation:

```json filename="settings.json"
{
  "sentriflow.incrementalValidation": true,
  "sentriflow.maxFileSize": 1000000
}
```

## Updating the Extension

The extension auto-updates by default. To update manually:

1. Open Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X`)
2. Click the gear icon on SentriFlow
3. Select "Check for Extension Updates"

## Uninstalling

1. Open Extensions view
2. Find SentriFlow
3. Click **Uninstall**
4. Reload VS Code
